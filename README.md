# Archery Scoring System

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **automated archery scoring system** that accurately detects and displays arrow impact positions and scores in real time.

## 🔧 System Description

The system includes:

- A **sensor-equipped frame** positioned in front of the archery target.
- **Impact detection** when an arrow passes through or hits the frame.
- A connected **software interface** that:
  - Identifies the arrow's point of contact on the target.
  - Calculates the score based on standard archery scoring zones.
  - Visualizes each shot on a digital display.

## 📌 Key Features

- Real-time shot detection and scoring  
- Visual feedback with impact mapping  
- Easy-to-use interface for archers and coaches  
- Lightweight and portable hardware setup  
- Accurate scoring with minimal manual intervention

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Embedded systems (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)  
- IR/laser/pressure sensors (depending on design)  
- Data communication via USB/Wi-Fi  
- Front-end dashboard (Python GUI / Web App)

## ✅ Applications

- Archery practice and performance tracking  
- Scoring system for competitive matches  
- Coaching tool for impact analysis  
- Gamified archery experiences

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Session recording and analytics  
- Multi-arrow trajectory tracking  
- Integration with mobile devices and cloud platforms  
- Voice feedback and scoreboard projection
